# Sprint_4
Description: you need to write a program, and then - cover it with tests and run the build in Jenkins.

The program allows to print owner's data on a bank card. To do this, the printer is given a string with the name and surname - for example, "Timothy Schalame". It can be printed if the following requirements are met: the string has at least 3 and no more than 19 characters, there is only one space in the string, the space is not at the beginning or at the end of the string.

The program must check if the string can be printed on the card. For example, "Timothy Schalame" is allowed, but "TimoteiChevrolet" is not. The program will consist of two classes: the main class, and a class with a method to validate the string, which contains the name and surname.
